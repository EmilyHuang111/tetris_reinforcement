## Tetris with Reinforcement Learning

This project is a Tetris game implemented in Python with reinforcement learning capabilities. It allows a user or an AI to play Tetris, and includes features to train the AI using a Q-Learning model. The game includes a visual interface with `pygame`, AI decision-making with a pre-trained model, and training using PyTorch.

## Features

- Fully functional Tetris game implemented in Python.
- Custom AI model (`CUSTOM_AI_MODEL`) trained using reinforcement learning.
- Game engine capable of running with or without visual rendering.
- Replay memory for efficient Q-Learning training.
- TensorBoard integration for tracking training metrics.
- Configurable board size, block size, learning rate, and other training parameters.
